## What does it do?

* A replication of the standard c library's printf function.
* Uses varargs so you can format n number of values into a string.
* Handy for debugging.
* Handles floating points.
* Has most of the flags that appear in the og printf.

## DISCLAIMER

<p>
This is a project from the 42 school, which is a school that utilizes peer to peer learning.
We're only given a document that gives us the details of the assignment, therefore each implementation
is unique. Each assignment is tested for crashes and other bugs thoroughly by other peers. Apart from some exceptions, existing
libraries are banned, these projects utilize our self made version of libc called libft.
